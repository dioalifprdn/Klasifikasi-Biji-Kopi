Title:
Classification of Coffee Bean Quality Based on Images

Background:
Coffee is a high-value commodity with significant economic importance. The quality of coffee beans greatly influences their taste and market price. The manual sorting process requires a significant amount of time and precision, and is prone to errors.
With advancements in technology, coffee bean quality classification can now be performed automatically using digital images. This study aims to develop a system for classifying coffee beans into two categories—good beans and damaged beans—based on images. The results are expected to enhance sorting efficiency and accuracy in the coffee industry.
